Here are my initial plans for GenerativeAICamp. 
The original idea for GenerativeAICamp comes from my experience running 100's of CloudCamps, which was a wildy successful unconference, community-driven event series, with an in-person event format. 
I was inspired to start GenerativeAICamp by ChatGPT along with my desire to create a new format for in-person events with an online backbone.
The time was determined by time & locaiton. My employer is providing us a free event venue in a city where there is a lot of people who could participate. 
So how should I go about making this happen? Well, it starts with who. 

Who should attend?
The most likely people to benefit from GenerativeAICamp are those exploring new opportunities or creating startups in the GenAI space, 
as well as those who or interest in learning how Generative AI might improve thier work and are looking for new technologies to discover. 

How can you attend. 
The first event will be located in-person and will not be livestreamed. But it may be recorded.
